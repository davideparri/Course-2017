We hereby announce the allocation of teams and classrooms for the flipped classroom presentations on Monday 18th September.

LB 5173.0151: Team 3, Team 7, Team 14
LB 5173.0157: Team 1, Team 5, Team 15
LB 5173.0141: Team 2, Team 6, Team 13
LB 5174.0178: Team 8, Team 10, Team 12
LB 5173.0045: Team 4, Team 9, Team 11

Please note that all these rooms are in the Linnaeusborg (Nijenborgh 7) and we advise all teams to locate the rooms before Monday's presentations.

All rooms are guaranteed to have beamers and some place to write on (markerboard / chalkboard) as well as a way to connect to laptops or other devices. 

We do need to mention however that it is the responsibility of the teams to ensure the proper ports/connectors are there to connect to your laptops should you wish to use them (perhaps test them beforehand). 
Part of presentation skills is knowing your environment before time and adapting appropriately so we leave this up to you as teams to organise yourselves. Inability to connect will not be considered a valid excuse.

Finally a reminder, as stated in the assignment, the digital presentation material you plan to use should be submitted via pull request on github before the end of Sunday 17th September.
